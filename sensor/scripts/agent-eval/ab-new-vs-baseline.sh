# A/B a lattice-sensor retrieval/steering change: the NEW build (current HEAD) vs a
# BASELINE build (a git ref) — BOTH with lattice-sensor attached — on the same
# implementation task, measuring how many Read vs lattice-sensor calls the agent
# makes. ISOLATES the change (unlike run-all.sh's with-vs-without). The agent
# works on a throwaway copy of the target, so your repos are never touched.
#
# Reliable attach (works even when this is itself run nested inside a Claude
# session): each arm PRE-WARMS a persistent lattice-sensor daemon for its target so
# claude connects to an already-bound, index-loaded daemon instantly — before
# the agent's first turn — and SKIPS lattice-sensor's startup re-exec via
# LATTICE_SENSOR_WASM_RELAUNCHED=1. Without this, on a multi-step task the agent
# dives into Read/grep before lattice-sensor finishes its ~2-3s startup (worse under
# the CPU contention of a nested run) and runs with NO lattice-sensor.
#
# Gotcha: claude's `system/init` snapshot can read status:"pending" / 0 tools
# even when the server then connects fine — judge by ACTUAL lattice-sensor usage in
# parse-run.mjs's "by type", not the init line.
#
# Usage: ab-new-vs-baseline.sh <indexed-repo> "<task>" [baseline-ref]
#   <indexed-repo>  a repo with a .lattice/sensor index (copied per arm)
#   "<task>"        an implementation task, e.g. "Add X to Y and wire it through"
#   [baseline-ref]  git ref for the BEFORE build (default: HEAD~1)
# Env:
#   AGENT_EVAL_OUT  output dir (default: /tmp/ab-new-vs-baseline)
#   RUNS            runs per arm (default 1). Run-to-run variance is large —
#                   use >=2 and report the range, never a single run. Both arms
#                   build/index ONCE and then run RUNS times, so raising this is
#                   far cheaper than re-invoking the script.
#   MODEL / EFFORT  default sonnet / high. Never raise without a reason: sonnet
#                   is the deliberate floor model (see CLAUDE.md).
#
# Both arms run with LATTICE_SENSOR_NO_PROMPT_HOOK=1: the machine's ambient
# UserPromptSubmit front-load hook resolves to whichever build is currently in
# dist/, so leaving it on injects context through a second, uncontrolled channel
# and confounds the tool-call counts this script exists to compare.
